I implement Order-Images API Protocol.

I download images from a service and store them locally. I know how to name downloaded files, how to extract UUIDs from them, how to create required directories and save files locally.

All hardware-specific classes utilize me. I do not know how to name order-level local directories and were to create them. Hardware-specific classes take me that function as well as root orders directory path.

API:

serviceResponse: aDictionary - set service response

rootPath: aString            - set full path to orders root directory

createDirectoryName: aBlock   - specify procedure to generate directory name 

downloadOrder
